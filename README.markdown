2.  [optional:] get rid of the -ggdb flags in makefile;
3.  [optional:] open build-linux (if you leave it, game_binary will be copied to ~/Desktop/) and comment out lines 3-4;
4.  run "bash build-linux".

For Windows:

1.  you must have MinGW installed;
2.  run "PATH <your_mingw_install_path>\bin";

Feel free to add to the list if you have a different operating system handy.
