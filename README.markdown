Yore
====

Yore is an under-developement roguelike console game.

Build instructions:
At the moment Yore is capable of running only on Windows and Linux systems.
To build for Linux:
* you must have make and gcc installed;
* [optional:] get rid of the -ggdb flags in makefile;
* [optional:] open build-linux (if you leave it, game_binary will be copied to ~/Desktop/) and comment out lines 3-4;
* run "bash build-linux".

For Windows:
* you must have MinGW installed;
* run "PATH <your_mingw_install_path>\bin";
* run "makefile.bat".

Yore runs (tested) on the following platforms:
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Windows XP
* Windows 7
Feel free to add to the list if you have a different operating system handy.
